# wide variety of faile modes = the node has many sons
# unlikely
# as they often are, often is indicator for more important
# "do not prevent the safety requirements from being met" is incident and not measure despite prevent? "affected item
# prevented in its functions"
# "post-incident' indicates reactive measure e.g. post-accident monitoring system
# reduce can be measure or incident
# indication for probability of incident: "probability of occurrence of certain human induced events, such as external explosions or aircraft crashes, is considered very low"
# what about the word "coincident"
# indication for importance ranking: "Phenomena that are expected to show a slow development may receive a
# lower level of consideration in the safety analysis, provided that it can be
# demonstrated that corrective actions could be taken before there were serious
# consequences for plant safety"
# indication for importance: "paramount"
# is this an incident?: "complexity and difficulty of the required action"
# incident indicator: challenge, challenging
# preclude indicates preventive character despite "pre"
# ranking indicator: "While these measures are not normally as reliable as passive
# engineered systems, they nevertheless can provide additional safety benefits."
# preventive indicator: precautionary
# preventive character: "potential incident" indicates that it is assumed and measures are likely to be preventive
# explosions,
# ranking indicator: "flood and wind might have higher dispersion potential than extreme
# ambient temperature"
# definitions as exact match of concepts: "Perforation is the state when an impacting missile has passed completely
# through the target"
# "missile impact" how about relations between those? broader?
# ranking indicator: "preferred"
# ranking indicator: "extreme care should be"
# reactive indicator: during, after
# if something unknown is listed with known incidents it is also likely that the unknown entity is an incident
#\emph{Located outside the building} is a \emph{separation measure}.
# Is broadness in the SKOS sense the same as abstractness?
#Metric for important concepts: small words that appear often are abstract concepts. What is a measurement for the grade of abstractness of a concept.
