Case1046;Pub1126_scr.pdf;security measure;Missiles, pipe whip and flooding may damage electricalequipment or cause its malfunction (such as spurious actuation). Thenumber and extent of items of electrical equipment and wiring in anuclear power plant make it virtually certain that a missile traversing theplant would disable some electrical circuits. The mechanism for damagein such cases can include the severance of cables, the destruction ofequipment or electrically initiated fires. In designing protection againstindirect damage from impacts on electrical equipment, such techniques asthe physical separation of redundant circuits, the use of fail safe circuits,the proper application of fuses and circuit breakers, adequate fireprotection and the appropriate use of barriers should all be evaluated.The most appropriate course of action will be determined by the specificsof the PIE under consideration. For example, if a postulated missile ismetallic and can introduce unintended connections between cables, thismay influence the degree of reliance on fuses and may make other meansof electrical protection more attractive. It should be noted that thecomplex potential failure modes of electronic circuits mean that it is unlikely that a full assessment of the hazard consequences can be made; apessimistic failure mode should be assumed unless the items areprotected from the effects of the hazard.

Case1119;Pub1202_web.pdf;security concept structure;The values of activity concentration provided in this Safety Guide can beused in the practical application of the concepts of exclusion, exemption andclearance as established in the BSS. Exclusion relates to exposures that areessentially unamenable to control and this publication provides regulatorybodies with quantitative guidance on the application of this concept toexposures from naturally occurring radioactive material. Exemption meansexemption from the requirements for practices as outlined in the BSS.Clearance is similar to exemption, but relates specifically to the removal ofradioactive material within authorized practices from any further control bythe regulatory body. Bulk amounts of material may be involved in clearanceand for this reason regulatory bodies may wish to adopt more stringent valuesof activity concentration than those given in Schedule I of the BSS, which applyonly for the exemption of moderate quantities of material. This Safety Guideprovides values of activity concentration that may be used by regulatory bodiesfor determining when controls over bulk amounts of material are not requiredor are no longer necessary.

For these reasons, therecommendations in this Safety Guide should be graded2 for their applicabilityto a particular research reactor (see Ref. [1], paras 1.11?1.14). Grading may beof assistance in determining the appropriate frequency for maintenance,periodic testing and inspection.

These include: the availability of data forthe site; the possibility of reliable extrapolation to lower excess values; the designapproach to be adopted; the compatibility with national standards for hazardevaluation and design; and public acceptance issues. In this context, basic referenceis made to a probabilistic approach for the site evaluation stage, while the derivationof single values on the probabilistic distributions to be applied in deterministic designprocedures is left to the design stage. The procedures for probabilistic safetyassessment (PSA) of external events, as part of the design assessment process, arediscussed in another IAEA Safety Guide [5].

The next step in the fulldetermination of the design basis for a specific plant is carried out in a design context,being intrinsically dependent on the layout and design. This additional step istherefore discussed in the series of standards relating to design, together with thedetailed loading schemes and the design procedures, owing to their constitutivedependence. Hence, in this Safety Guide, the term ?design basis? should beunderstood as being limited mainly to that part of the determination of the designbasis that is independent of any procedure for plant layout or design.

Training of plantpersonnel includes the permanent plant staff as well as contractor personnel whomay be temporarily assigned to the plant. Finally, Section 10 addresses the qualityassurance programme as it relates to specific fire safety issues, and the need tomaintain adequate records and documentation. The Annex provides additionalinformation on inspection, maintenance and testing in the form of a sample listof features, systems, equipment and components to be considered in relation tofire safety.

In some cases it also presents preliminaryguidance for deriving values of relevant parameters for the design basis. This SafetyGuide is also applicable for periodic site evaluation and site evaluation following amajor human induced event, and for the design and operation of the site?senvironmental monitoring system. Site evaluation includes site characterization;consideration of external events that could lead to a degradation of the safety featuresof the plant and cause a release of radioactive material from the plant and/or affect thedispersion of such material in the environment; and consideration of population issuesand access issues significant to safety (such as the feasibility of evacuation, thepopulation distribution and the location of resources). The process of site evaluationcontinues throughout the lifetime of the facility, from siting to design, construction,operation and decommissioning.

The draining of coolant fromequipment or tanks by a siphoning action should also be considered inassessing the consequences of a pipe rupture. Depending on the amountand nature of the liquid concerned, indirect damage to items important tosafety can result by means of such effects as an electrical short circuit, fire,hydrostatic pressure effects, wave action, thermal shock, instrumenterrors, buoyancy forces and criticality risk (in relation to boron dilution).If there is a potential for the significant flooding of items important tosafety, in most cases the prudent course of action is to reduce P2 toacceptable levels, since it is very difficult to predict and mitigate all thepossible effects of flooding.

The BSS,which are based on information on the detrimental effects attributed toradiation exposure provided by the United Nations Scientific Committee onthe Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR) [2] as well as on therecommendations of the International Commission on Radiological Protection(ICRP) [3], are intended to provide the basis for the regulation of both?practices?1 and ?interventions?2.

A Safety Requirementspublication [4] establishes the requirements for the legal and governmentalinfrastructure that is necessary to implement the BSS effectively. An essentialelement of this legal and governmental infrastructure is a national regulatorybody that has the authority to establish or adopt regulations (Ref. [4], para.2.2). Furthermore, ?In order to discharge its main responsibilities, theregulatory body shall establish a process for dealing with applications, such asapplications for the issuing of an authorization, accepting a notification or thegranting of an exemption, or for removal from regulatory control?

Section 4 discusses design considerations with regard tothe ability to maintain, test and inspect research reactors and experiments.Section 5 presents recommendations and guidance for the preparation of theprogramme for maintenance, periodic testing and inspection. Sections 6 to 9develop the main concepts of this programme. Sections 10, 11 and 12 discussmaintenance facilities, procurement and storage of spare parts, and inspectionmethods.
